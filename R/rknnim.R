#' Rolling KNN Imputation
#'
#' Performs rolling window KNN imputation on a numeric matrix to handle missing values.
#' The matrix is divided into overlapping windows, and imputation is applied to each window.
#' Overlapping regions are averaged to produce the final imputed matrix.
#'
#' @param obj A numeric matrix with \strong{samples in rows} and \strong{features in columns}.
#' @param n.feat Integer specifying the number of features (columns) in each window. Must be between 2 and the number of columns in \code{obj}.
#' @param n.overlap Integer specifying the overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 10. Must be between 0 and \code{n.feat - 1}.
#' @param k An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to use for
#'   imputation. Must be between 1 and the number of columns.
#' @param colmax A numeric value between 0 and 1. This is the threshold for the
#'   proportion of missing values in a column. Columns exceeding this
#'   threshold will be imputed using the column mean instead of k-NN.
#' @param rowmax A numeric value between 0 and 1. This is the maximum
#'   allowable proportion of missing values in any single row. If a row
#'   exceeds this threshold, the function will stop with an error.
#' @param method A character string specifying the distance metric for k-NN.
#'   Acceptable values are `"euclidean"`, `"manhattan"`, or `"impute.knn"`.
#'   Defaults to `"euclidean"`. See [knn_imp()].
#' @param cores Number of cores to parallelize calculations of distances over. Note: if .parallel is TRUE and cores = n, then each mirai::daemons() process will spawn n cores.
#' @param .progress Logical indicating whether to show a progress bar. Default is FALSE.
#' @param .parallel Logical indicating whether to use parallel processing for multiple windows. Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @return A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{obj} with missing values imputed.

#' K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Imputation
#'
#' This function imputes missing values in a numeric matrix using the k-Nearest
#' Neighbors algorithm. It follows a two-stage process. First, it imputes
#' columns with a proportion of missing values below `colmax` using k-NN.
#' Second, any remaining missing values (including those in columns that
#' exceeded `colmax`) are imputed using the column mean.
#'
#' @details
#' The distance calculation between columns for identifying nearest neighbors is
#' scaled based on the number of non-missing value pairs. Specifically, the
#' raw distance is penalized by scaling it up for columns that have fewer
#' overlapping observations. This penalizes distances for columns with very few
#' shared observations used for distance calculations. The
#' `impute.knn` method averages the distances over the number of matching positions,
#' so a column with only one matching value to calculate distance from might have a lower
#' raw distance than a column with many matched values. See also [stats::dist()].
